<h2>Description</h2>
Consider an imaginary business scenario where a software solution provider aims to migrate to cloud environment, specifically Amazon Web Services (AWS). They need both a production environment, including a website for license sales and a database for storing sensitive customer data, and a non-production environment for testing and development purposes, using diverse operating systems. Additionally, the company seeks secure connectivity between their on-premises systems and the cloud environment, requiring a VPN connection.
<br />

Developing a robust cybersecurity plan for businesses begins with meticulous identification and protection of critical assets. These assets comprise sensitive data like customer information and financial records, along with vital systems such as servers and networks. Additionally, safeguarding the repository of codes and systems within the development cloud environment is crucial for protecting intellectual property (IP) and ensuring smooth business operations.
With digital transformation and remote work becoming prevalent, the conventional approach of trusting all within the internal network lacks adequate security. Hence, the zero-trust architecture (ZTA) has emerged as a reliable industry best practice. In the subsequent sections, we will introduce ZTA and explore the secure hybrid cloud solution deployed, addressing specific business needs.
